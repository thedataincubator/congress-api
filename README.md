# Congress [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thedataincubator/congress-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thedataincubator/congress-api)
 This is the API address for propublica(https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/):
This repo is a python package to access the propublica API.

To get started clone the repo locally and
1. Ask Zach to get permissions to push branches
2. Choose an issue to work on and comment that you want to work on it.  Or create your own issue and comment that you want to work on that.
3. Make a branch (or two or three or ...) and open up a PR with a change you like.  Some issues will already have PRs open, just push to those branches!
4. Ask for a review from a peer.
5. Ask for a review from Zach, Tim or Dylan.
6. Once both reviews are passed, an instructor will merge.

Some useful commands:
- Checkout new branch `git checkout -b branch_name`
- Push new branch `git push --set-upstream origin branch_name`
- Switch branches `git checkout branch_name`
- Rebase on master `git rebase master`

This is a Python 3 application

## Helpful Hints
Run tests with `python -m pytest`
