      "text": "Mr. Speaker, I was absent December 2nd due to a medical appointment. Had I been present, I would have voted no on Roll Call Vote 600, agreeing to the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. This year's NDAA passed by the House of Representatives continues to contain spending for wars that were never authorized by Congress, mandates restrictions on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and supplements Pentagon spending with $67.8 billion in Overseas Contingency Operation funds. For these reasons, I oppose the Fiscal Year 2017 NDAA. However, the NDAA did include a lot of meritorious provisions that I support including a 2.1 percent pay increase for our military men and women. Those who serve in uniform have already made extraordinary sacrifices for our country, and have earned and deserve a pay raise. I also strongly support the provisions that address the growing problem of sexual assault in the military by updating the Uniform Code of Military Justice and providing public access to court documents and proceedings. Additionally, I support the addition of language to direct the DOD to complete a review of all California Guard members who were impacted by the California National Guard Bonus Recoupment scandal and alleviate financial hardship for California Guardsmen who were erroneously paid bonuses. I am appalled that the Pentagon punished service members for [[Page E1651]] mismanagement by National Guard officials, and previously signed a letter to the Secretary of Defense demanding that the DOD halt recoupment efforts. Despite progress on these issues, I have serious concerns with the bill. I have always advocated for maintaining Congress's constitutionally-confirmed prerogative to declare war under the War Powers Act and limiting the President's authority to engage in armed conflict without the consent of Congress. I strongly oppose the NDAA's authorization of spending for wars that are not congressionally approved. The President has sent troops to Iraq, Syria and elsewhere without seeking an Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF), a violation of the War Powers Act. Additionally, the NDAA continues to bar the use of funds from transferring detainees from the Guantanamo Bay prison and prevents the President's plan to permanently close this facility. The prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the United States, has eroded relationships with our allies, undermined U.S. missions, and put our troops at risk of retaliation. Most importantly, this bill fails to rein in the only federal agency that is not fully auditable and continues to authorize wasteful spending without implementing proper oversight of the Pentagon's budget. I am outraged by a recent report revealing $125 billion dollars in largely administrative, bureaucratic spending at the Pentagon was covered up. I have fought for fiscal responsibility and accountability at the Pentagon so that scarce funds can better be spent on the basic needs of our troops, obligations to veterans of past wars and other domestic priorities throughout my time in Congress. Although this year's NDAA contained significant bipartisan compromises it also failed to address some of my longtime concerns.",
